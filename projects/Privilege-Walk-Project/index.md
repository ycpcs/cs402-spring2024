## Privilege Walk Project Description
The Privilege Walk exercise demonstrates how your specific collection of characteristics, aspects, and events in your life can accelerate or hinder your progress and achievments in life, relative to other people with a different collection of those charactersitics, aspects, and events.  It is intended to initiate and facilitate a meaningful dialog on impacts of privilege, diversity, and inclusion among various groups of people.

Here are links to two descriptions of the Privilege Walk exercise:

  - [EIU Privilege Walk Exercise](https://www.eiu.edu/eiu1111/Privilege%20Walk%20Exercise-%20Transfer%20Leadership%20Institute-%20Week%204.pdf)

This is the third year for the Privilege Walk project, with a faculty member from the York College Psychology program serving as your client [Dr. Randi Shedlosky](https://www.ycp.edu/academics/school-of-behavioral-sciences-and-education/faculty/shedlosky-shoemaker-randi.php).  You will find the initial project requirements [here](PrivilegeWalkApplicationDescription.pdf).

You will be continuing development of this project, building upon the accomplishments of this past Fall's CS Capstone I (CS400) team.  Your general task is to **finish** the project.  It is expected that this will be last semester for this project as a Capstone project.  The goal is to deliver the final version of the Privilege Walk application.
