## YCPHacks Project Description

You will be continuing development of this project, building upon the accomplishments from the [YCPHacks Capstone I (CS400) Team from Fall 2023](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs400-fall2023/projects/YCPHacks-Website-Project).

The goal for this semester is to deliver a functional website for the Fall 2024 YCPHacks Hackathon that includes User Registration, as well as administrative tools, notifications, and inventory management.  It is **NOT** expected that this will be the last year for YCPHacks Website development, but this Spring's team should aim to deliver a functional website that can take on more of the registration process, while enhancing and refining various other aspects of the existing YCPHacks functionality.

Here is the [initial description for the YCPHacks Website Project](YCPHacks-Capstone-Project-Description.pdf)
