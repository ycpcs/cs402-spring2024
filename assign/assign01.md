# Tasks

There are three tasks: 

1.	Decide what it is you individually want to accomplish this semester.  You will be developing a list of Learning Objectives and then Learning Activities that match those objectives.  Then, you will need to match those Learning Activities to tasks that need to be completed for your respective team project.  That will be your individual proposal.
2. Develop a "wish list" of what you want out of the semester, regardless of the existing issues, feature development, and future work that carried over from the Fall semester.  Prioritize that list, and then see if you can adapt the items on your list to the work that needs to be done on the project.
3. Collaborate with you fellow team members to work out how each of you achieve your golas while also contributing to the project.  This will be a negotiation with your teammates, your clients, and your instructors.  The output of that negotiation will be the basis for your team's [Project Proposal, Detailed Design, and Schedule (assign03)](./assign03.html).
