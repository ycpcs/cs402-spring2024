# Expectations for Weekly Journals, Stand-Ups, and Demos

On the weeks that you do not have an assignment or Milestone to present, you will have stand-up meetings.  Here are the expectations for the weekly journal and stand-up meetings.  

## Journal entries (individual)

As in the Fall, you will each maintain a **Weekly Journal** as a shared Google doc on your team's drive.  Your journal entries should capture your work for the week so that you can present accurate information at your weekly stand-up meeting.

Your weekly journals are due by 11:00am (before class) on the day of your stand-ups/Milestone presentation, and **MUST** address the following points:

- Briefly describe what your TEAMS/s are working on, and your contribution to that progress.
- Describe what YOU accomplished over the past week
- Include screen captures, links to external resources, and whatever information may be relevant to the research and work that you investigated/accomplished - throughout the project, your weekly journal will accumulate your research, your accomplishments, and the effort you have put forth
- List the challenges you faced that impeded your progress, and explain how you dealt with them
- Make sure to include links to your major commits for the week

**NOTE:** Do **NOT** wait until the last minute to update your weekly journal.  You are to maintain this journal **daily**, as you perform work on the project.  Do **NOT** rely on your memory to capture your weekly effort at the end of the week.

## Stand Up Meeting (individual/team)

Present your progress on the issues you have been working on for the week.  A stand-up meeting is generally of the form (for each person on the team):
- What you had planned or were supposed to accomplish
- What you did accomplish
- What you did not accomplish (if anything)
- Why you did not accomplish it (if anything), and who/what is blocking you
- What you need in order to catch up on those unfinished tasks (if anything)
- What you will accomplish next week


## Demoonstrations (individual/team)

During the weekly stand-up meetings, present relevant demos that succinctly display your individual and your team's progress.  You can leave detail out of the stand-up presentation by referring to the demo.

Your isntructors might also ask you to present additional demos of your progress

## Ways that you can demonstrate progress include

- **Requirements, analysis, and design artifacts**: During the early stages of the project, documenting requirements, modeling the problem domain, and developing a system design to meet the requirements are very important in order to create a solid foundation for your system.  In addition, as you iterate later in the semester, it is useful to update parts of the requirements and analysis/design models in order to support further progress towards meeting the system requirements.
- **Prototype code**: A stand-alone proof-of-concept demo is fine, especially in the early stages of the project.  Prototypes can quickly inform you of the viability of an idea or approach.  And, it will likely be code that you will ultimately throw away.  As such, you should describe how your prototype effort will ultimately contribute to the main code base.
- **Working, tested, integrated code**: Assuming that your team has a solid design, this is generally the most important type of contribution.
- **Equipment/apparatus**: If your project has external equipment or apparatus, then you can show us progress on its construction and setup.  However, time spent on equipment/apparatus should be the mininum necessary to support the needs of the software you are creating.

# Evaluation

For each weekly meeting, you (individually) will receive one of the following evaluations:

* **5 - Exceeds expectations**: We think you are making an extraordinary contribution to your project, and that overall, your team is on course to demonstrate a very strong final product.
* **4 - Meets expectations**: We think you are making an adequate contribution to your project, and that your team is on track for a solid (but perhaps not exceptional) final product.
* **3 - Below expectations**: We are concerned that you are not making a sufficient contribution to your team's project, and that your team's final product will not meet the minimum expectations.
* **2 - Insufficient**: We observed very little evidence that you conducted productive work over the last week and the project may be showing inadequate progress.
* **1 - Extremely weak**: We observed almost no or mostly trivial work performed over the last week, which resulted in very little progress. 
* **0 - Unacceptable**: No work was performed over the last week.

**NOTE: Late weekly journal entries will receive a 50% deduction from the grade they would have otherwise received.**
